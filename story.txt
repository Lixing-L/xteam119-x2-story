In ancient China, there was a person who studied for three years did not pass the exam. Then he decided to learn martial arts.
He was very talented in martial arts.
But, he mistakenly injured his instructor and was driven away. Finally,he studied Chinese medicine and wrote a prescription. Unforunately, he died because of using his own prescription.
But we will never forget what his story taught us.
